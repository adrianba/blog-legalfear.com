My name is [Ade Bateman](https://adebateman.org) and I am a law student at the [University of Washington School of Law](https://law.uw.edu/) in Seattle. My background is in technology and for several years I wrote blog posts about technical topics at [https://adrianba.net/](https://adrianba.net/). This blog is intended to provide me with a place to write about legal issues.

I'm still learning about the law so if you see something that you disagree with or that is just plain wrong, please feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adrianba) or via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrianba).
